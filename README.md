DayZ Chernarus - HirumaYoichi730s-Trader.
I had this idea for a Trader at Radio Zenit

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the items are every weapons in the game that is in the types.xml files.
And there is also attachments for every weapons in the store. The magazines for the weapons are the big ones for each weapon, except for the K-AM weapon that has a magazines that holds up to 300 rounds of tracer ammo.
And for those weapons that has different colours are out too. For an instance instead of 1 silver Desert Deagler, there is also a golden Desert Deagle too.

The Main Store holds the weapons and their attachments. The backrooms however, that holds all the ammoboxes except for tracer ammo. And the last end of the backroom is a table with flares for the flare gun and on the shelves next to it are the ammo for the M79 Grenade Launcher.

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/HirumaYoichi730s-Trader.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/HirumaYoichi730s-Trader.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
